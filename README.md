# Daily morning briefing
The daily morning briefing sends an overview of the weather, news headlines and a funfact through Whatsapp.

It scrapes public (german) websites for information and sends it through whatsapp using twilio.

This is my first published project - feel free to leave comments and feedback.


## Set up and useful links:
